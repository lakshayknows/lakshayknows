## About

Started in Commerce where numbers tell stories and decisions have consequences.
Moved into AI where models predict, fail, and occasionally surprise you.

I build **intelligent systems with restraint**:
less buzzwords, more intent.
Currently focused on **LLMs, NLP pipelines, Rust fundamentals**, and learning how systems behave when scaled, stressed, or misunderstood.

```rust
fn main() {
    let direction = vec![
        "LLM pipelines & evaluation",
        "NLP systems with real-world constraints",
        "Rust for correctness-first engineering",
        "AI informed by business intuition"
    ];

    println!("Currently exploring: {:?}", direction);
}
```
